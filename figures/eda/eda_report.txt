EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS - KEY TAKEAWAYS
================================================================================

1. FEATURE CORRELATIONS WITH COMPRESSIVE STRENGTH:
   - cement: +0.498
   - superplasticizer: +0.366
   - age: +0.329
   - blast_furnace_slag: +0.135
   - fly_ash: -0.106
   - coarse_aggregate: -0.165
   - fine_aggregate: -0.167
   - water: -0.290

   Strongest positive correlation: cement (0.498)
   Strongest negative correlation: water (-0.290)

2. AGE TRANSFORMATION:
   - Original age correlation: 0.329
   - Log(age) correlation: 0.549
   - Log transformation improves correlation by 0.221
   → Recommendation: Use log(age) as feature

3. DATA QUALITY:
   - Missing values: 0 (Perfect!)

4. OUTLIERS:
   - blast_furnace_slag: 2 outliers (0.2%)
   - water: 9 outliers (0.9%)
   - superplasticizer: 10 outliers (1.0%)
   - fine_aggregate: 5 outliers (0.5%)
   - age: 59 outliers (5.7%)
   - compressive_strength: 4 outliers (0.4%)

5. TARGET VARIABLE (Compressive Strength):
   - Range: 2.33 - 82.60 MPa
   - Mean: 35.82 MPa
   - Std: 16.71 MPa
   - Skewness: 0.417

6. KEY INSIGHTS FOR MODELING:
   - Cement content shows strongest positive correlation with strength
   - Water has negative correlation (higher water/cement ratio → lower strength)
   - Age effect is non-linear; log transformation recommended
   - No missing values; minimal preprocessing needed
   - Wide range of mixture compositions allows for diverse predictions
